# Basic School Website

This is a basic front-end project for a school website. No frameworks, no backend, just raw HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Created a while ago, mostly for practice or a class project.


## 🔧 Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS (handwritten)
- JavaScript (no libraries)


## ⚠️ Notes

- Static only – no server, no database.
- Forms don’t actually submit anywhere.
- Images are just basic banners and a header.
